# Customer-Churn-Predictor

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive solution for deploying a trained model using Streamlit to provide an interactive web application for real-time churn prediction. The project demonstrates embedding Machine Learning models into a user-friendly interface using Streamlit. It enables third-party stakeholders, who might not have technical expertise, to interact with and utilize machine learning models without needing to delve into the complexities of Jupyter notebooks.
